Pet Project One: Complete

Original Files and Idea: Net Ninja, "TypeScript Tutorial" Playlist

This was a project meant to help me better understand and grow comfortable working in TypeScript. This was a great
and complex first project that tested my debugging skills (and, sometimes, my patience). Because of this, I now feel
more comfortable coming up with my own plans to create TypeScript projects. 

To use this app, open the HTML in a Live Server (I suggest using the Live Server extension in VSC). When the webpage
opens, follow the instructions. 

  - Choose whether the logged transaction will be an invoice or a payment.
  - Enter the name of the individual who owes or is owed moeny.
  - Add a brief description for the work they did (only a few words).
  - Enter the amount in numbers.
  - Hit 'Enter' or 'Add'

Expected Result: You will see a set of text that neatly repeats the information provided in the boxes below it.
